# Evaluation-of-the-FIWARE-platform
Creation of the FIWARE platform and simulation of a sensor. Evaluating the system, how many messages it can withstand per minute.
Using Docker and docker-compose tool i created a combination of FIWARE containers and MongoDB, CrateDB, Mosquitto and Grafana. 
Also the simulation was done on Raspberry Pi3 using a Python code. For communication protocol i used MQTT and the data was generated in JSON format.
